I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My research is focused on integrating privacy-preserving algorithms into everyday applications to protect user data. I take a hardware/software co-design approach to all of my projects, proving the feasibility of our work on FPGA. Alongside this, I have focused on building robustness into emerging learning paradigms, such as federated learning. Some of the primitives my most recent works have been focused on are Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). I am a researcher in the Adaptive Computing and Embedded Systems (ACES) lab advised by Professor Farinaz Koushanfar.

Bio
==========
I am the last Sheybani to get my PhD in engineering! My mother has a PhD in Computer Science, my dad in Electrical Engineering, and my sister in Biomedical Engineering. My parents are professors at the University of South Florida and my sister is an assistant professor at the University of Virginia. I grew up in Colonial Heights, VA, moving on to Charlottesville for college at the University of Virginia, where I got my BS in Computer Engineering. A couple months after graduating, I joined UCSD's ECE program as a PhD student, focusing on hardware-software co-design of privacy-preserving computing systems under Professor Farinaz Koushanfar.
